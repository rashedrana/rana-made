# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Quantifying the Carbon Footprint: An Analysis of CO₂ Emissions across Domestic Demand.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do domestic consumption patterns and final demand across different countries contribute to the overall carbon footprint, and which sectors or industries drive the highest levels of embodied CO₂ emissions?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
2. Quantifying the carbon footprint associated with domestic consumption is an important problem because it directly impacts climate change mitigation efforts. This project analyzes CO₂ emissions embodied in domestic final demand across countries, using data analysis techniques. The results can provide insights into the most carbon-intensive sectors within economies, enabling targeted strategies to reduce emissions and promote sustainable consumption patterns.
## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: CO₂ Emissions embodied in Domestic Final Demand, Production, and Trade
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/7ba962035bb548bb9893add2b5491896_0/explore
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7ba962035bb548bb9893add2b5491896_0.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset shows the amount of CO₂ emissions from fuel combustion embodied in domestic final demand, production, and trade in between 1995-2021.
### Datasource2: Climate-related Disasters Frequency
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/d48cfd2124954fb0900cef95f2db2724_0/explore
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d48cfd2124954fb0900cef95f2db2724_0.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset shows the extent to which fossil fuel prices paid by consumers do not reflect the fuels’ full financial and social costs, expressed as an aggregate value for each fuel and economy.
